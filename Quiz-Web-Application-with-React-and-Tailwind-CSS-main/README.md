ðŸ§  Quiz Web Application with React and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the Quiz Web Application repository! This project is an interactive quiz platform built using React, leveraging the power of `useReducer`, `React Query`, and other powerful React libraries. The user-friendly interface and seamless user experience make it an ideal tool for creating engaging quizzes and surveys.

**Features:**
- **React**: A robust JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces, used to create the quiz app's components and manage state efficiently.
- **useReducer**: A powerful React hook that simplifies state management by dispatching actions and reducing them to a new state.
- **React Query**: A data-fetching library that provides a delightful caching and background data synchronization experience, making the quiz app more responsive and performant.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that facilitates the creation of modern and responsive user interfaces with minimal effort.
- JSON-Server: A fake REST API server that allows you to quickly prototype and test your application with mock data.
- Concurrently: A handy utility to run multiple commands concurrently, simplifying your development workflow.


**User-Friendly Quiz Experience:**
The quiz app offers an intuitive and interactive experience, enabling users to take quizzes seamlessly. They can navigate back to review their answers, and upon completion, they can instantly view their results.

**Customizable and Extendable:**
